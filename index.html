Welcome to my website! I'm Nihar. I've been a builder and tinkerer since dissassembling my first PC at age 9.\  
I'm currently a graduate student in Computer Engineering at the College of Engineering, Boston University. 📚💻😎\  
In the past I've been an engineering intern at Deloitte, and worked in a team responsible for an internal system audit tool. I worked on PowerShell and MySQL scripts used in database and operating system audits. More info can be found in my resume.  
I love building and reading about [systems](https://xkcd.com/974/)🤣.\  
You can find a few of the projects I've built on my [Github](https://github.com/nihardwivedi).\  
I strum the guitar whilst humming tunes for fun. If I'm unreachable I'm probably reading hacker news or playing a video game. 🕹🎸🎶\
