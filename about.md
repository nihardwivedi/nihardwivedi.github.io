## About Me

I'm a graduate student in Computer Engineering at the College of Engineering, Boston University. 📚💻😎  
I've been a builder and tinkerer since dissassembling my first PC at age 9. I strum the guitar whilst humming tunes for fun. If I'm unreachable I'm probably reading hacker news or playing a video game. 🕹🎸🎶
