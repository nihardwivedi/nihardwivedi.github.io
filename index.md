Hello, I'm Nihar. Welcome to my website! I’ve been a builder and tinkerer since disassembling my first PC at age 9. I like building highly scalable and reliable infrastructure for applications that have global scale and [reach](https://xkcd.com/974/).<br/><br/>

I’m currently a Software Engineer at a [CyberSec startup](https://www.securonix.com/). I work at the intersection of Operations, R&D and SWE so my work involves everything from arm twisting AWS to launch new (previously unavailable) Redis instances overnight to debugging production code only to find the issue is an edge case. 😎<br/>
I was a graduate Computer Engineering student in a past life at the College of Engineering, Boston University. 📚💻 <br/>
My current areas of interest include secure containerized applications, Distributed Computing, Cloud infrastructure, and IaC. Past interests have included React, GraphQL etc amongst other web technologies.<br/><br/>

In the past, I’ve been a software engineering intern at Deloitte and worked in a team responsible for an internal system audit tool,  more info can be found on my [resume]({{ site.baseurl }}/nihar_dwivedi_resume.pdf).<br/><br/>

You can find a few of the projects I've built on my [Github](https://github.com/nihardwivedi).  <br/>

I strum the guitar whilst humming tunes for fun. If I’m unreachable I’m probably reading Hacker News or playing a video game. 🕹🎸🎶  I’m also an ardent fan of science fiction, and I’m currently reading The Broken Earth series and plan to read the Three Body Problem next.<br/><br/>

My dream job would a fun mix of product and cloud engineering. If this sounds like a role you're hiring for, feel free to reach out!<br/>
