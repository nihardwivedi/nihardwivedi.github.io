Hello, I'm Nihar. Welcome to my website! I’ve been a builder and tinkerer since disassembling my first PC at age 9. I like building highly scalable and reliable infrastructure for applications that have global scale and [reach](https://xkcd.com/974/).<br/><br/>

I’m currently a graduate student in Computer Engineering at the College of Engineering, Boston University. 📚💻😎 <br/>  
My current areas of interest include secure containerized applications, ML and Cloud infrastructure, and IaaS. Past interests have included React, GraphQL, Redis amongst other web technologies.<br/><br/>

In the past, I’ve been a software engineering intern at Deloitte and worked in a team responsible for an internal system audit tool,  more info can be found in my [resume]({{ site.baseurl }}/nihar_dwivedi_resume.pdf).<br/><br/>

You can find a few of the projects I've built on my [Github](https://github.com/nihardwivedi).  <br/>

I strum the guitar whilst humming tunes for fun. If I’m unreachable I’m probably reading Hacker News or playing a video game. 🕹🎸🎶  I’m also an ardent fan of science fiction, and I’m currently reading The Broken Earth series and plan to read the Three Body Problem next.<br/><br/>

My dream job would a fun mix of product and cloud engineering. If this sounds like a role you're hiring for, feel free to reach out! I'll be graduating in January, and am actively looking for jobs.<br/>
