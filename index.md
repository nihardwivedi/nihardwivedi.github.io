Hello, I'm Nihar. Welcome to my website! I'm interested in solving complex problems arising in applications that have global [reach](https://xkcd.com/974/). I‚Äôve been a builder and tinkerer since building my first PC at age 9. <br/><br/>

I‚Äôm currently looking for my next adventure! ~~a Senior Site Reliability Engineer at a [cybersecurity scaleup](https://www.securonix.com/)~~. I work at the intersection of Operations, R&D, and SWE so my work involves everything from arm-twisting AWS into launching new (previously unavailable) Redis instances overnight to debugging unknown edge cases in production code. Working at a startup I've learnt to move fast while NOT breaking things(and quickly fixing things I do end up breaking!), and have worn various hats such as SWE, SRE, Cloud Security Engineer etc as the business evolved. <br/>

I'm a Jan 2021 Computer Engineering graduate from the College of Engineering, Boston University. <br/>

My current areas of interest include Distributed Computing and Infrastructure engineering. Past interests have included React, GraphQL, etc amongst other web technologies.<br/><br/>

In the past, I‚Äôve been a ,  more info can be found on my [resume]({{ site.baseurl }}/nihar_dwivedi_resume.pdf).<br/><br/>

You can find a few of the projects I've built on my [Github](https://github.com/nihardwivedi).  <br/>

I strum the guitar whilst humming tunes for fun. If I‚Äôm unreachable I‚Äôm doing one of three things- browsing Hacker News, watching anime, or playing a video game. I‚Äôm also an ardent fan of science fiction and software engineering books, and I‚Äôm currently reading Designing Data Intensive Applications. ~~Red Rising, Dark Matter, The Broken Earth series, Three Body Problem~~<br/><br/>

My dream job would be a fun mix of distributed systems/Infrastructure and product engineering. If this sounds like a role you're hiring for, feel free to reach out!<br/>
