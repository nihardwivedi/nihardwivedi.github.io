Hello, I'm Nihar. Welcome to my website! I’ve been a builder and tinkerer since disassembling my first PC at age 9. I like building highly scalable and reliable infrastructure for applications that have global scale and [reach](https://xkcd.com/974/).<br/><br/>

I’m currently a Senior Site Reliability Engineer at a [cybersecurity scaleup](https://www.securonix.com/). I work at the intersection of Operations, R&D, and SWE so my work involves everything from arm-twisting AWS into launching new (previously unavailable) Redis instances overnight to debugging unknown edge cases in production code. <br/>
I'm a Computer Engineering graduate of the College of Engineering, Boston University. <br/>
My current areas of interest include containerized applications, Distributed Computing, Cloud infrastructure, and IaC. Past interests have included React, GraphQL, etc amongst other web technologies.<br/><br/>

In the past, I’ve been a software engineering intern at Deloitte and worked in a team responsible for an internal system audit tool,  more info can be found on my [resume]({{ site.baseurl }}/nihar_dwivedi_resume.pdf).<br/><br/>

You can find a few of the projects I've built on my [Github](https://github.com/nihardwivedi).  <br/>

I strum the guitar whilst humming tunes for fun. If I’m unreachable I’m probably reading Hacker News or playing a video game. I’m also an ardent fan of science fiction, and I’m currently reading Dark Matter by Blake Crouch. ~~The Broken Earth series and plan to read the Three Body Problem next~~<br/><br/>

My dream job would be a fun mix of product and cloud engineering. If this sounds like a role you're hiring for, feel free to reach out!<br/>
