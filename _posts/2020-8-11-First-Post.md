### The Idea
The thought of building my personal website has long been at the back of my mind. I first learnt it was possible to do so in sixth grade. Prior to that I believed only big corporations like Google or Microsoft could build and deploy websites. I registered my very first domain soon after and deployed a simple html site that only contained my name and a couple of old nineties style wordart. It was fun building it! But soon after I realized I would have to learn css and jquery if I was to build any semblance of a decent website.  
To a sixth grader those first few lines of code were highly intimidating. Without a mentor to guide me (and this was pre-YouTube era) I simply gave up. The domain expired soon after and I never gave it another shot.  
It was in college I started coding again and I reregistered the domain. I then built a barebones portfolio site with broken links and a copy pasted theme. I guess I never liked the idea of tinkering with css and styling everything manually(Little did I know about the existence of SASS!). I again gave up.  
TL;DR This is my third attempt. Imagine my surprise when I came across awesome tools like Jekyll and some very [nice people](https://github.com/barryclark) who have already setup ready to deploy [sites](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) that you can fork on GitHub, and lo and behold my site is ready and delpoyed within the hour, with only some minor editing. It even has a custom domain! It took me longer to write this post than it did for me to fork, setup, and deploy my website!  

### The Execution
Follow the instructions as given [here](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). You just need to fork this repo, rename it to your-username.github.io and edit the template. Yep that's it! Your site will be deployed at http://your-username.github.io/ . If you want to add your custom domain, then point your domain to Github's address, instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site).

### Conclusion
It has become very easy to setup websites, and with tools like Squarespace you don't even need to know coding to build a professional looking websites. Automation will make building products and businesses as simple as a few clicks in near future hopefully, with your imagination being the only limit. I hope you're doing great, and see you in the next blog post!
