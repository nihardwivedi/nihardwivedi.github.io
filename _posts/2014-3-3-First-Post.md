### The Idea
I have been thinking of building my own website since middle school when I first learnt it was even possible. I used to think only big corporations like google could build and deploy websites. I got my very first domain soon after and deployed a simple html site with virtually my name and a couple of old 90s style wordart. It was fun building it! But soon after I realized I would have to learn css and jquery if I was to build any semblance of a decent website. To a 6th grade kid those first few lines of code were so intimidating without a mentor to guide me that I gave up. The domain expired soon after and I never thought of renewing it again until I was in college. Thereafter I did register it again and built a barebones portfolio site with broken links and a copy pasted theme. I guess I never liked the idea of having to handle my own css and styling everything manually(I didn't know about the existence of SASS!). I again gave up.
TL;DR This is my third attempt. Imagine my surprise when I came across awesome tools like Jekyll and some very nice people who have already setup ready to deploy sites that you only need to fork, and lo and behold my site is up within an hour. It even has a custom domain!
